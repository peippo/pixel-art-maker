# Udacity Project: Pixel Art Maker

Final project for Udacity's Google Front-End Web Development Scholarship (first phase). The project specifications were to build a grid dynamically based on user input, and allow the user to modify colors of the grid cells. I decided to go with a limited two color palette to reduce the required UI components and make it easier for the user to start creating something.
